Welcome to Zhuo's Lab, wnich is called **Super Efficient Machine Learning Lab**. We are focusing on developing novel and efficient learning algoritms for both：
- **Artificial Intelligence** (e.g. LLMs, Diffusion models, Optimization Algorithms ...) and，
- **Theoretical Machine Learning** (e.g. Variational Inference, Theorys for Transfer Learning, Stein's method, Gaussian processes ...) problems! 


Zhuo Sun is a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the School of Statistics and Data Science at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, starting from July 2025. 
- Before joining the lovely family of SUFE, he was a senior research scientist at Huawei, working on **post-training & model compression** of large language models.
- Previously, he received his Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computational Statistics on **variational inference & meta-learning & Monte Carlo...** from University College London and a master degree in statistical science from University of Oxford. He is looking for self-motivated PhD/Master/Interns.

## 📢 Recruitment
I am looking for:
 *  **🎓PhD students** and **📘Master students**.  
 *  **🧑‍🔬research interns** on a long-term basis (> 3 months).

**Expectations and Support for PhD and Master Students:**
- Good character and strong intrinsic motivation, with genuine interest in research exploration.  
- Satisfy at least one of : solid mathematical background (probability and statistics) & strong programming skills (eg Python and PyTorch).

**What you can expect:**
  - Students are encouraged to pursue research topics that they are interested in. I will provide full guidance within my expertise, and facilitate collaborations beyond my expertise.  
  - 📚 For students interested in academia, I will guide you in research projects and collaborations, and support your further academic development.  
  - 💼 For students interested in industry, I can recommend you for internships in leading research divisions in the field.  

📩 If you are interested in the above research directions, please feel free to contact me:
