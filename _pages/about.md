Welcome to Zhuo's Lab, wnich is called **Efficient Machine Learning Lab**. We are focusing on developing novel and efficient learning algoritms for both：
- **General Artificial Intelligence** (e.g. LLMs, Diffusion models, Optimization Algorithms ...) and，
- **Theoretical Machine Learning** (e.g. Monte Carlo, Variational Inference, Theorys for Transfer Learning, Stein's method, Gaussian processes ...) problems! 


Zhuo Sun is a **tenure-track Assistant Professor** in the School of Statistics and Data Science at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. 
- Visiting Reseacher at Imperial College London, collaborating with Prof. Harrison Bohua Zhu, Prof. Yingzhen Li and Prof. Samir Bhatt.
- Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computational Statistics: on variational inference & meta-learning & Monte Carlo... from University College London (supervised by Prof. François-Xavier Briol and Prof. Jinghao-Xue) and a master degree in statistical science from University of Oxford. He is looking for self-motivated PhD/Master/Interns.
